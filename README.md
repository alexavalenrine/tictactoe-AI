Tic Tac Toe AI (Practice Project)

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game with an unbeatable AI, built using Python (Tkinter).
It was created as a practice exercise while studying for the *Harvard CS50 “Python with AI” certificate program.

Features

* Interactive GUI using Tkinter
* Play against a smart AI that uses the Minimax algorithm
* User-friendly, clean interface
* Detects wins, losses, and draws automatically

Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Tkinter (for GUI)
* Minimax Algorithm (AI logic)

How to Run

1. Clone the repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/alexavalenrine/tictactoe-gui.git
   cd tictactoe-gui
   ```
2. Run the game

   ```
   python3 tictactoe_gui.py
   ```

Purpose

This was built as part of my journey learning Artificial Intelligence with Python.
It helped me understand how game logic, recursion, and AI decision-making work together.
